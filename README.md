# Hand-Written-Letters-Classification-With-OpenCV-and-Sklearn
This program uses two types of classification: SVM and Decision Tree and, then, runs the reports in the end in order to compare.

Make sure you have all dependencies installed, like OpenCV and Sklearn.


-> To run, first decompress "OCRDataSet.zip"

-> Then run "alphabetCreate.py" to create the images from the csv dataset

-> Run "preprocessing.py" to the first adjustments in the images

-> Run "datasetGenerator.py" to create the features table

-> Finally, run the "classification.py" to classificate the images using SVM and Decision Tree.
